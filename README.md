# pattern-language

This guide covers the implementation of an DDD application (tactical design) in Django and with an emphasis on implementation variants Django developers are used to.

This guide does not cover the modelling of an DDD application (strategic design).

To learn more about strategic design I can highly recommend the guides and templates of the [Domain-Driven Design Crew](https://github.com/ddd-crew) on GitHub.

The guide covers how to map strategic design into an implementation in the Django context however.
To make this explicit corresponding sections are post-fixed with "(strategic pattern)".

## Project type patterns

![project type patterns](static/project_type_patterns.drawio.svg)

The overall project type is important cause it implies the need for or unsuitability of patterns in a cross-cutting manner.

### Multi user groups

Context:

- You want to provide a web application to several user groups (e.g. related to different companies).

Example:

- SaaS provider of cloud computing resources for different companies (e.g. [codesphere.com](https://codesphere.com)).

### Single user group

Context:

- You want to provide a web application to a single user group.

Examples:

- You are running a learning website for end users (e.g. [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com)).
- Internal tool for data management in a single team within a company.

### Multi-tenancy

Context:

- You've little requirements w.r.t. security and data separation.

### Single tenancy

Context:

- You've a multi user groups use case and are working in a restricted domain with strict security and data separation requirements (e.g. healthcare, finance).
- You've a single user group use case.

Examples:

- You are provider of cloud resources in the finance domain for companies in the finance industry (e.g. [metalstack.cloud](https://metalstack.cloud)).
- You are running a learning website for end users (e.g. [udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com)).

## Subdomain (strategic pattern)

Core, generic, supporting.

### Core subdomain (stategic pattern)

Context:

- You've identified a high complexity subdomain with your domain experts and your companies market analysts which does differentiate you from competing companies and/or brings you ahead of a competing company.

Problem:

- What tactical DDD patterns should I use to implement a core domain?

Solution:

- In many cases core domains require an implementation with advanced patterns like [Event Sourcing](https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html), [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html), 

### Generic subdomain (strategic pattern)

Context:

- You've identified a low or medium complexity subdomain with your domain experts which does not differentiate you from competing companies.

Problem:

- Generic subdomains are already/should already be solved.

Solution:â€š

- Search reusable Django apps. Good resources are e.g.
  [Django Packages](https://djangopackages.org),
  [best-of-django](https://github.com/fkromer/best-of-django),
  [wsvincent/awesome-django](https://github.com/wsvincent/awesome-django),
  [shahraizali/awesome-django](https://github.com/shahraizali/awesome-django).
- Evaluate if the Django app solves your needs, integrate and customize it (e.g. packaged views) if necessary.

Resulting context (advantages):

- You depend on a third party package.
  You don't have to implement, test and maintain the subdomain yourself.

Resulting context (disadvantage):

- You depend on a third party package.
  The project could end in an unmaintained state.

Implementation examples:

- In many applications Djangos built-in authentication system is not sufficient.
  This subdomain can be implemented using the de-facto standard Django-app [allauth](https://github.com/pennersr/django-allauth).
- Djangos built-in support for emails is suitable for development only.
  The Django-app [django-anymail](https://github.com/anymail/django-anymail) can be used to abstract away email service provider specifics behind a unified API.

## Bounded context (strategic pattern)

Context:

- You've applied domain modelling and came up with a model for a subdomain.

Problem:

- You don't know how to map the bounded context into an implementation in Django.

![bounded context patterns](static/bounded_context_patterns.drawio.svg)

### Django single app bounded context

Context:

- The bounded context is rather simple.

Solution:

- Map the bounded context to a single Django app.

Example implementation:

```
src
|_ single_app_bounded_context
   |_ admin.py
   |_ models.py
   |_ ...
|_ django_project
   |_ settings
      |_ base.py
      |_ ...
   |_ urls.py
   |_ ...
|_ manage.py
|_ ...
```

### Django multi app bounded context

Context:

- The bounded context is rather complex.

Solution:

- Map the bounded context to several Django apps.

Example implementation:

```
src
|_ multi_app_bounded_context
   |_ app_1
      |_ admin.py
      |_ models.py
      |_ ...
   |_ app_2
      |_ admin.py
      |_ models.py
      |_ ...
|_ django_project
   |_ settings
      |_ base.py
      |_ ...
   |_ urls.py
   |_ ...
|_ manage.py
|_ ...
```

### Django bounded context data separation patterns

Context:

- Data should be private to a single bounded context.
- You want to persist data using Djangos built-in support for SQL databases (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL, ...).

Problem:

- Per-default Django uses a single, shared database. Bounded context specific data is not separated.

#### Bounded context specific database table namespace

Solution:

- Prefix Django database tables (e.g. via corresponding Django models) with an application specific prefix.

Resulting context:

- It's obvious what data relates to what bounded context.
- Data is only "private by convention" (comparable with Python class "dunder" methods).

#### Bounded context specific database schema

Context (additional):

- You use a database for persisting data with support for database schemas:
  Postgres, MySQL, ...
  (You don't use SQLite.)

Solution:

- Use a dedicated database schema (collection of tables) for a single bounded context.

Implementation examples:

Databases with [built-in Django support](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/ref/databases/#databases):

- Postgres: [schema](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html)
- MariaDB: ?
- MySQL ["database"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/create-database.html)
- Oracle: ?
- SQLite: SQLite does not support collecting tables relating to a single bounded context in a schema in a database.
  https://stackoverflow.com/a/33962375/5308983
- In-memory SQLite:
  Same as for SQLite. The in-memory database does not support database schemas.

The same what applies to SQLite applies to quite a lot distributed, relational databases as well:

- [rqlite](https://rqlite.io) [github - rqlite/rqlite](https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite)
- [Fly.io LiteFS](https://fly.io/docs/litefs/)
- [dqlite](https://github.com/canonical/dqlite) [github - canonical/dqlite](https://github.com/canonical/dqlite)
- [Turso libsql](https://turso.tech/libsql) / [github - tursodatabase/libsql](https://github.com/tursodatabase/libsql)
- [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1)

#### Bounded context specific database

Solution:

- Use Djangos built-in support for [multiple databases](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/topics/db/multi-db/#multiple-databases).

Example use case:

- Usually personal data is required to be handled with care.
  In many applications the user data of the authentication subdomain is persisted in a separate database.

Resulting context:

- It's obvious what data relates to what bounded context.
- Highest degree of data separation.
- Data can be separated physically.
- Offers most control w.r.t. developer side data access priviledges.

## Repository patterns

### Django ORM repository

Context:

- The bounded context you want to model is no CRUD domain.

Solution:

- Add domain models (DTOs) for entities/aggregates (and value objects). One domain model for each entity/aggregate.
- Add Django ORM models for entities/aggregates. One Django ORM model for each entity/aggregate.
- Map fields of entities/aggregate from/to Django models.

Resulting context:

- Django ORM models are not used as domain models as well (Active Record pattern).
- Django ORM models depend on the domain models (dependency inversion).
- Django ORM models are not tightly coupled to data persistence implementations (in-memory, SQLite, Postgres, ...) supported by the Django ORM.
- Application code does not contain persistence specifics anymore.

Resulting context (advantages):

- Application code is decoupled from the data persistence implementation.
- No "fat" Django ORM models anymore.

Example implementation:

### JSON field repository

Context:

- Mapping between entities/aggregate DTOs and Django ORM models introduces lot of repetitive boilerplate.

Solution:

- Use a single `data = models.JSONField` in the Django model to wrap all entity/aggregate DTO data.

Resulting context (advantages):

- A generic repository can be used for several entities and aggregates.
- There is little need for SQL schema database migrations. Migrating JSON data can be easier.
- Works with noSQL databases as well.
- Writing entities/aggregates should be faster (when using a performant implementation making use of e.g. `pydantic`).

Resulting context (disadvantages):

- Benefits of the Django ORM w.r.t. development workflow (migrations, queries, ...) cannot be used anymore.
- Filtering data from JSONFields might be harder and slower.

Example implementations:

- [Another way to persist DDD Aggregates in Django](https://michalgodkowicz.medium.com/another-way-to-persist-ddd-aggregates-in-django-d148f4cad298):
  Little boilerplate Django ORM to/from `pydantic` entity/aggregate mapping by using a `models.JSONField` to wrap all aggregate/entity data.

### Cached repository pattern

Context:

- Data is mutated rather infrequently.

Problem:

- Every time data is requested from the repository it needs to be fetched from the database.

Solution:

- Cache the data when it's fetched after the first data mutation after cache invalidation.
- Invalidate the cache if data is mutated via the write part of the repository.

Resulting context (advantages):

- Cached data reads are way faster.

Resulting context (disadvantages):

- Latency for data fetches varies significantly.
- Data writes might be a bit slower.

Example implementations:

- [Repository Pattern with Caching and Hangfire in ASP.NET Core](https://codewithmukesh.com/blog/repository-pattern-caching-hangfire-aspnet-core/)

### Time series data repository patterns

![time series data repository patterns](static/time_series_data_repository_patterns.drawio.svg)

#### OLTP use cases

Context:

- You've a [Online transaction processing (OLTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_transaction_processing)
  use case (need for data manipulation like creation, update and deletes). CRUD use cases with moderate need for R.

Example:

- You want to create a web application for data management and mutation of time series data.

Implementation example:

- Implementation making use of [QuestDB](https://github.com/questdb/questdb) and [Python Client](https://questdb.io/docs/clients/ingest-python/) for data persistency.

#### OLAP use cases

Context:

- You've a [Online analytical processing (OLAP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing)
  use case (a lot of data, fast read performance, no need for data manipulation). CRUD use cases without CUD and high need for R.

Example:

- You want to create a web application dashboard for business analysis.

Implementation example:

- Implementation making use of [TimescaleDB](https://github.com/timescale/timescaledb) and [`psycopg2` lib](https://docs.timescale.com/quick-start/latest/python/) for data persistency.
- Implementation making use of [CrateDB](https://github.com/crate/crate) and [Python Client](https://cratedb.com/docs/python/en/latest/index.html) for data persistency.

### Repository specification pattern

Problem:

The interface of repository classes (abstract + concrete) tends to get broad.

Solution:

Keep the interface of the repository class interface and it's concrete implementations narrow.
Do not implement several `get()` and `get_all()` query methods or adding several paramaters to single `get()` and `get_all()` query methods.
Define a single `get()` and `get_all()` method with a single parameter `specification` instead and pass the complete filter and sorting meta data via this parameter.

- [Specification](https://github.com/ardalis/Specification): Base class for adding specifications to a DDD model in C# .NET (EF6 and EF Core).

### Unique identifier alternatives

Keep an eye out for domain specific identifiers.
In most cases it makes sense to use them to identify model instances or (aggregate root) entities in the domain model.
Fallback to some kind of randomly generated ID format as fallback.

#### Domain specific unique identifiers

- Books are uniquely identified by [International Standard Book Number (ISBN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISBN). The ISBN can be used as unique identifier in the e-commerce domain.
- Car models are uniquely identified by [Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_identification_number). The VIN can be used in domains where car models are relevant.
- ...

#### Random ID formats

- [uuid-utils](https://github.com/aminalaee/uuid-utils): Wrapper for Rust implementations of `uuid1`, `uuid2`, `uuid3`, `uuid4`, `uuid5`, `uuid6`, `uuid7` and `uuid8`.

## Bounded context integration patterns

### Context mapping (stategic pattern)

Integration between subdomains/bounded contexts involves the strategic pattern *context mapping*.

[ddd-crew/context-mapping](https://github.com/ddd-crew/context-mapping)

### Partnership

Solution:

- Bounded contexts are integrated in an ad hoc manner.

### Shared kernel

Context:

- Bounded contexts share a limited overlapping model.

### Conformist

Solution:

- The consumer conforms to the service providerâ€™s model.

### Anticorruption layer

Solution:

- The consumer translates the service providerâ€™s model into a model that fits the consumerâ€™s needs.

### Open-host service

Solution:

- The service provider implements a published languageâ€”a model optimized for its consumersâ€™ needs.

### Separate ways

Solution:

- Duplicate particular functionality (violate against DRY principle by intention) in several subdomains/bounded contexts.

- [Learning Domain-Driven Design - Chapter 4. Integrating Bounded Contexts](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-domain-driven-design/9781098100124/ch04.html)

## In-memory database

For various functionalities like e.g. caching we depend on in-memory databases.

### Redis

One first implementation is [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis)  which has been and is probably still the de-facto standard.
For production we can choose from a variety of fully managed service providers.

- [Redis Cloud](https://redis.io/cloud/)
- [Upstash for Redis](https://upstash.com/docs/redis/overall/getstarted) (PaaS [fly.io](https://fly.io) provides [integration](https://fly.io/docs/reference/redis/))

### Dragonfly

[dragonfly](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly) is a drop-in replacement for Redis.
Dragonfly is compatible with the Redis API.
Dragonfly is easier to manage and seems to be way faster however.
For local development you can install it as [binary](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/getting-started/binary),
use the [Docker container](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/getting-started/docker) e.g. with a [Docker Compose file](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/getting-started/docker-compose)
or in a local Kubernetes cluster with [Helm Chart](https://www.dragonflydb.io/docs/getting-started/kubernetes).

For production it's easiest to use the fully managed [Dragonfly Cloud](https://www.dragonflydb.io/cloud) service.
